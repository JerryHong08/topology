# Topology

A shared human-agent interface for task tracking. Just markdown files and your great ideas.

Topology parses markdown roadmaps into a queryable graph, giving agents a map to navigate and humans a clear view of progress.

## Background

The coding paradigm has shifted from playful vibe-coding to agent-driven development, but the interface hasn't kept up:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Before
        Human1[Human] -->|input| Agent1[Agent]
        Agent1 -->|search from scratch| Code1[Codebase]
        Agent1 -->|produce| Output1[Output]
        Output1 -->|review| Human1
    end
```

Each input is discrete. Agents reconstruct context every time. There's no shared memory.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph With Topology
        Human2[Human] -->|observe / edit| Topo[Topology]
        Agent2[Agent] -->|query / update| Topo
        Topo -->|maps| Code2[Codebase]
        Agent2 -->|produce| Output2[Output]
        Human2[Human] --> |review|Output2[Output] 
    end
```

Topology is the shared state — a roadmap system that both humans and agents can read and write.

## How to use

1. install the topology skills

```
npx skills add https://github.com/JerryHong08/topology
```

2. Try it
```
hi, can you use /topology skill to help me upgrade/initial my current project tasks?
```

## How it works

Think of your project as a city. ROADMAP.md is the map showing all destinations, `roadmap/*.md` are the detailed routes to each one. The `topo` skill teaches agents to read and update the map; the CLI is their navigation tool.

In the future I will introduce hooks and api endpoint which will enable human to manage the tasks, orchestrate the agents in web UI.

**For Agents:**
- `topo` CLI navigates the roadmap: find tasks, read context, update status
- One call to `topo context 1.1` returns the task goal, subtasks, and linked docs
- Convention-driven: agents follow [CONVENTION.md](.agents/skills/topology/CONVENTION.md) to draw and maintain the map

**For Humans:**
- ROADMAP.md is the single source of truth — standard markdown, readable anywhere
- `roadmap/<slug>.md` holds task discussions and design decisions
- ARCHIVE.md keeps completed work out of the way but still queryable
- In the future, there will be web ui for better ux

## File structure

For every task:
- task description
- task status(task inbox/task section)
- task id
- (optional)task doc under roadmap/task.md

```
ROADMAP.md              ← active tasks (hot)
ARCHIVE.md              ← done/dropped tasks (cold)
roadmap/
  <slug>.md             ← task detail docs and discussions
```

## CLI usage

```bash
# daily workflow
topo query -f status=todo              # find next tasks
topo query --status                    # progress summary
topo context 1.1                       # task details + linked docs
topo update 1.1 status=in-progress     # claim task
topo update 1.1 status=done            # complete task
topo archive                           # move done/dropped to ARCHIVE.md
topo scan .                            # refresh graph
```

See [SKILL.md](.agents/skills/topology/SKILL.md) for full agent instructions.

## Task lifecycle

```
idea → discuss → todo → in-progress → done → archived
                                     → dropped → archived
```

Important tasks go through a **discussion phase** before execution — captured in `roadmap/<slug>.md` with context, analysis, decision, and plan. See [CONVENTION.md](.agents/skills/topology/CONVENTION.md).

## Install

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Requires Rust toolchain. The binary is installed to `~/.cargo/bin/topo`.

         │ ROADMAP.md  │
         │ ARCHIVE.md  │
         └─────────────┘
```

Both CLI and API use the same core operations from `ops/`, ensuring consistent behavior.
